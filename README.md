# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
The classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. This app has several features including a feature where players can enter their names and will count the number of wins a player has won overall before hard resetting back to zero for both sides. The game will also indicate who's turn it is with the custom names entered for each player.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

My learning was focused to around Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and this game was a perfect introduction in trying to utilize it as much as possible. 

## Optimizations

It would have been nice to be able to add more OOP into the project overall. Not too much optimization needed as (I think) my code was pretty lean, but maybe I will think otherwise in the future.

## Lessons Learned:

Object Oriendted Programming is very important to understand and utilize. It took a couple tries to get it right but once I was able to the code overall is cleaner and much easier to read. Going forward I want to utilze more OOP in my future projects to get into a solid practice and foundation on the benefits of OOP.
